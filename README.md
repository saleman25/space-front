# A Little About Space React App

Houston we have a problem... We need to know more about space! With this app you can see the Astronomy Picture of the Day, the most viewed NASA projects, and pictures from each of the Mars Rovers! All brought to you by the NASA Open APIs.

You can find the repo to my backend here: https://github.com/saleman25/space-backend.git

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
 
which will open up localhost:3000 for you. Once you make sure your backend is up and running as well youre good to go! Enjoy learning a few new things regarding space!
